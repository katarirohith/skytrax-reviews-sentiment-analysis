Emirates,6,1656,3,4,4,3,3,"['Oslo to Dubai. Have flown with Emirates several times and this is by far the worst experience ever. The crew took a long time to serve dinner and by the time it got to us  they had already run out of beef  and we werenÃ¢ÂÂt even sitting towards the back of the plane. No apology was given for the limited choices and the FA gave a take it or leave it tone with us. The snack was served shortly after and no one bothered to collect the trash from us after that. One FA told us to leave it behind. Unprofessional service!', 'Singapore to Prague via Dubai. Extremely lousy service  traveling in a group of 8 and treated rudely. Crew woke us up and ask whether do we need food to be served  we say no and the crew replied ""if you donÃ¢ÂÂt want it now we are not going to warm it for you laterÃ¢ÂÂ. Controller of mini screen donÃ¢ÂÂt come out  ask crew member to help  she pressed several times and replied Ã¢ÂÂif you canÃ¢ÂÂt take it out I canÃ¢ÂÂt tooÃ¢ÂÂ. Asked whether we want chicken or beef  we said beef  crew member say I will take a look and never come back again. Asked another crew member  he told the previous one that she has missed us  she snapped and walk away. In the end no food was served. I know itÃ¢ÂÂs economy class but I donÃ¢ÂÂt think we deserve this.', 'Very smooth trip from Dubai to Hamburg. Our chauffeur picked us up well ahead of time and from pick-up to entry to the Emirates Lounge at T3 it took just 30 minutes. We boarded on time and even though it was a busy service (full business class) we were very well looked after by a professional cabin crew. Food and wines offered on the nearly 7 hour flight was very good and of highest standard. We even had time to enjoy a cocktail at the bar and relax before we started our descent into Hamburg. It is fantastic that the A380 is now also flying to Hamburg and great to have both options now  the B777 and A380 on this route.', 'Great service on both flights from Hamburg to Dubai and Dubai to Hong Kong. Smooth transits and punctual departures. Excellent and helpful crews and very professional and attentive service on both flights. Great food  excellent wines and the best entertainment system. Emirates never disappoints.', 'Shanghai to Dubai. Fantastic crew. Emirates has never let me down with their service  be it on the ground or in the air. Very punctual chauffeur pick-up from the hotel to the airport  smooth boarding and one of the best crews ever on this flight. Super attentive and ever so helpful  I could have stayed onboard for much longer!', 'Gatwick to Kuala Lumpur via Dubai. We had 21 kg excess luggage when the ground staff saying  you have 21kg of stuff to dispose of. When my husband asked him again what he was saying then only heÃ¢ÂÂs explaining either we pay or throw our stuff for 21 kgs. This is lack of professionalism to me. Not only that  the supervisor was rude too. Without a smile and arrogantly he said either you pay or you throw then he walked away. We all know this but at least display a professional and appropriate manners towards us. We ended up paying 5kg excess. I bought a return ticket for the first time and this should be my last. Never again to travel with this airline.', 'Newark to Athens. When we received the email from Emirates to check in we were offered an upgrade to Business for $600 per person.  We took it  thinking that we would be wowed by Emirates world class service  food and reputation. Read on. After checking in online we called to find out more about Emirates' car service  knowing we were outside the 50 mile radius we were willing to pay the difference. ""No' we were told  ""you booked the super saver upgrade  so you are not eligible"". Really? Even if we would pay for it? After we checked in at the airport we asked where the lounge was located. ""No"" we were told ""you booked the super saver upgrade  so that doesn't get lounge access"". Funny  didn't see mention of that when Emirates took my $1200. (we got into the lounge any way). Boarded an old 777-200. It was late (almost midnight). We had a nice cocktail and dinner and went to sleep. Forgot to put the sticker on my shirt and so 2 hours before landing  and in the middle of a nice deep sleep  was awoken by the FA who asked what I wanted for breakfast (even though he could see I was sound asleep). My husband was out like a light and the FA said ""I guess he doesn't want breakfast"". Astute observation. Before I went to sleep and after I woke up I tried to find something to watch on the IFE. Nothing. It was late so there was no question that we would be sleeping  but the seat was not full flat and the hard arm rests were hard to maneuver around. Overall I would say that I was glad we got to upgrade  but felt sorry for those folks who paid a lot more than we did for the same experience.', 'Delhi to London via Dubai. Seating was alright. At both ends and particularly on the return leg I took note of the lethargic stewardesses. They had no concern about the passenger comforts. Consequently  in spite of having probably 12 staff serving Dinner/Refreshment the service was very late. Meals were served almost 80-90 minutes after take-off. On the return journey flight took off from London at 20.30 and my turn (middle of the Aircraft) came at 22.00. Food was run of the mill and not enough to fill me at least.', 'Dubai to Singapore. Whatever Executive approved the 2x3x2 configuration for the Boeing 777 fleet  did Emirates a huge disservice. Will never fly the Emirates Boeing 777 again. A business class seat should not require you to ""either"" climb over the person next to you  or require the person next to you  to climb over you  to get to the aisle. Will only fly airlines whose business class cabin is 1x2x1  or offers ""direct aisle access"" from every business class seat.', 'Dubai to Houston. I have never experienced such a complete & total lack of professionalism  by any airline. Travelers can encounter a problem on any airline  but it is how an airline handles a problem that is most important. This experience on EK was a ""case study in abject incompetence"". The flight was boarded on time  but departure time came & went  & passengers were left sitting  with zero flight deck contact for almost 1.5 hours before the 1st contact by The Captain. There had been a problem with a smoke detector in the crew's sleeping cabin  but it would soon be fixed & we would be ""on our way in about 15 minutes"". Yet again  we sat with no update k for over another hour  by which time the flight was 2.5 hours late. The Captain then made a 2nd announcement that it had taken longer to fix the problem than anticipated  but we would ""now depart in about 10-15 minutes"". However  for a 3rd time  passengers were left sitting another 1+ hour with no flight deck contact. What kind of flight crew training does EK provide  where a Captain thinks it is OK to let passengers sit in silence on a flight delayed 3+ hours  yet make only 2 incorrect announcements? After sitting for 3.5 hours the Captain direct all passengers to collect their belongings & deplane. So 100's of passengers deplane  but those in 1st & Business Class on the upper deck had another surprise waiting. Neither the Captain  or the flight crew had alerted ground staff that upper deck passengers had been directed to deplane. As a result  all 1st & Business Class passengers were crammed at the end of the jetway in front of the 2nd floor elevators  with no place to go! Passengers could enter the elevators  but security had disabled the floor selection buttons after the plane had originally boarded. Passengers started to bang on the glass walls to try & get the attention of security staff who could be seen in the distance  but unable to hear through the heavy glass walls. Passengers finally returned to the plane to tell the ""totally clueless"" flight crew  there was no place to go & passengers were trapped in the small  2nd floor area. Security personnel finally noticed passengers banging on the wall & 1 unlocked a 5th floor door & came to the 2nd level via stairwell  since they also could not operate the elevators. This employee then directed all 1st & Business Class passengers to carry all their belongings up 6 flights to the 5th floor Business Class Lounge! What a fiasco of total incompetence. The flight ended up being 5.5 hours late  but once airborne  passengers quickly learned that even though the plane had sat at the gate for almost 6 hours  it had not been re-catered  so the flight was serving a ""breakfast"" menu  even though the flight departed at almost 4:00PM. No dinner would be served  but rather a light snack  since the menu was still for the ""original"" flight times. After flying for 25 years  I have never experienced a more incompetent flight operation. Not 1 EK employee mentioned any compensation  even though  passengers should have received some type of compensation!', ""I traveled from Trivandrum to Dallas via Dubai to visit my 94 year old dad who was in critical condition in the hospital. However  he passed away the night before my flight. I was forced to change my return from November 14 to November 8 as my dad's funeral was on November 5. I had a 20 hour layover in Dubai on my return and Emirates was to provide me hotel and meals in Dubai on my scheduled return date of November 14. However  even though I used the exact same flight combination for my return from TVM to Dubai and Dubai to DFW on November 8  Emirates refused to provide me hotel and meals at Dubai. I had to pay an extra $85 for hotel and approximately $50 for meals. As it is  I paid $1 609.54 originally for the ticket which I thought was overpriced and an additional $375 in penalties and fare difference for changing my return date. I am left wondering whether Emirates is in the business of providing air transportation or of highway robbery. I have traveled on Emirates previously and I definitely got the feeling that not only are they nickel and diming their passengers but their cabin and ground crew at DFW service are much worse than before."", ""Odessa to Hanoi via Dubai. I had a very bad experience with Emirates. On 3rd July  2018 my wife and I took a return flight from Odessa (ODS) to Hanoi ((HAN) via Dubai (DXB); After checked-in  We have waited in long time over boarding time  and then a lady likes a Representative of EK appeared and made a contact with passengers in lounge to announce that flight was delayed more. And in long time waiting that lady appeared again to notice that the incoming flight from DXB landed in Kishinev (Moldova)- KIV and then flew back at ODS in a couple time. We and passengers on this flight have continued to wait. Nearly 02 hours later the lady informed that the incoming flight would flight back to ODS  but crews were over duty time then there would be no outgoing flight to DXB from ODS  it means flight today cancelled. The alternative flight ODS-DXB would be on next day morning  but she didnÃ¢ÂÂt know when! How should I do when I was sure that We missed connecting flight from DXB to HAN? I showed our tickets  mentioned her that our connection flight to Hanoi and asked her what solution would be done for us. I received an answer from her: Ã¢ÂÂI cannot do anything here because there is no computer  no system. I have only telephone!Ã¢ÂÂ Even She didn't care on my connection ticket. And she informed that Passenger were provided meals and hotel for that night and would take flight on next day but she didnÃ¢ÂÂt know when! Emirates representative at ODS airport didnÃ¢ÂÂt offer me any alternative protected trip except meals an hotel for that night! No answer  no choice offered by Emirates for me. ItÃ¢ÂÂs was terrible and truly that Emirates have set own passengers like me and my wife aside and had no care. Fortunately  there was an flight from ODS to HAN later at 09:30PM by Turkish airlines on the same day. I requested Emirates representative to make endorsement to TK  but She replied that she couldnÃ¢ÂÂt do it. I requested her make a confirmation letter about EK flight cancellation to get refund later. She replied that I could get refund where I bought tickets and there people would know everything in airline system! Finally  I myself had to purchase 02 tickets on TK on the same day to fly back home. Until now nearly 4 months over I contact Emirate many times but no refund for cancelled flight was done!"", 'Madrid to Male via Dubai. I have never flown Emirates until last October 27 in a holiday trip with my wife to Maldives. Madrid to Male was nothing special: economy seats have average pitch  ICE system works fine and movies selection is huge apparently. Service onboard was quite bad  food was average  flight attendants were rude  the purser spent the whole flight shouting at the crew. They never asked if we wanted more bread or more cafe etc. The flight from Dubai to Male was scheduled at 3:15 am  so we wanted nothing but sleep. Even if we put on all of our ""resting stuff"" the flight crew woke up us at 5 am for breakfast. She said that she must assure that everyone on board was offered breakfast. On our return flights we found another surprise. As the travel agency gave us the booking reference two months ago I purchased the seats  as the fare the agency took did not allow to choose seats. I paid 140Ã¢ÂÂ¬ for the seats. So far so good until we checked in at Male airport. Our seats were changed with no reason. In both flights (MLE-DXB and DXB-MAD). The handling staff could not tell me any reasonable reason  and the finished with a great ""ask Emirates staff when you arrive to Dubai"". Great answer from a professional employee. But when I tried to get an explanation at Dubai my luck did not get better: after twenty minutes trying to hold a conversation  one person who supposedly was in charge gave me a piece of paper with a web site written and told me to fill an online claim. Great airline  great staff  great service. Onboard more of the same: bad service  rude crew  poor food and added to my other trip: my entertainment system did not work. Luckily I had my ipad with lots of stuff loaded. This was my first and my last trip with Emirates.', 'Seattle to Dubai. This was my first time with Emirates and I was expecting much more than this flight delivered. Just going down a short list: I expected better seat comfort  I hoped for more attention from the flight attendants (this was a 14 hour flight with only one visit by a flight attendant in the 14 hrs  that being after they served the meals). There were many  many children and some would not stop crying. The few bathrooms became dirty fast and stayed that way through the flight. Finally  the food was mediocre at the best. So  what I learned on my first Emirates flight is the experience of air travel with them is no better than Delta or American Airlines.', 'Brisbane to Singapore.Took early morning (overnight) flight.  Based on my previous positive experiences travelling the same route  I expected more. Although seemingly light load in all cabins  crew rushed both services in a way that suggested they just wanted to get it all over and done with. The result  impersonal service when there was the luxury of time to do much better. Several requests for drinks etc were misunderstood  because it seemed that the crew were making incorrect assumptions about what I wanted  instead of taking the time to ask and listen! Service aside  older style 777 cabin but nonetheless comfortable. Overall  it couldÃ¢ÂÂve been such a better experience if the crew made the effort to deliver a personalised service.', 'Perth to London via Dubai. My husband and I have been flying with Emirates to London from Perth for many years and had never encountered a problem before  until our latest flight to London  we had a 2 3hour delay. You prepare for youÃ¢ÂÂre flight only to have to return home did not experience good management in Perth about what to do. We were given Taxi fare to get home but the queue was very unorganised - some were getting hotels others cabs but were not directed. Eventually next day we back to Perth airport by now the excitement was gone so then mid flight was told one piece of luggage was left behind and will follow shortly but did not receive till day 3 so had to buy clothes - very disappointed to see it had been cut right across the top so we had to buy a new suitcase. Then on our return to Perth we had pre paid seats only to be told somebody else was in them so we by now weÃ¢ÂÂre most upset  but disappointed at the manner and rudeness of the staff in flight - especially a manager who shrugged and said Oh well bad customer service. We are now going back to Singapore Airlines.', 'Washington to Dubai. Flew on Emirates in April 2018. Best flying experience ever. Raved about it to everyone and booked another trip with them 6 months later. Same exact flight just 6 months later. Totally different experience. Service was so-so  they cut back on a few meals  no hot towels to clean your hands (only handy wipes now)  no random photographer taking flight photos) They are just like any other airline now.', 'I was travelling Emirates from Stansted to Hong Kong via Dubai  this is the first time I filed with Emirates as I live close to Stansted airport and this is the only route from Stansted to Hong Kong.  I was disappointed by my  experience. When I booked the ticket thru my travel agent  my seat is always classified as Confirmed as seen by online tracking. So to my very surprise  when I got to the Stansted Airport check in counter 3 hours before my flight departure  the staff at the check in counter told me that I was actually a Ã¢ÂÂstand byÃ¢ÂÂ passenger from Dubai to Hong Kong which they could not actually check me in and print my boarding pass  they said I could only confirm my seat when I arrive Dubai and they could do nothing in Stansted. I said to them that my seat status is always written as Confirmed on online tracking and I could not accept such an uncertainty only to find out if I will get a seat to Hong Kong when I arrive Dubai. The staff only explained because the plane was overbooked and I was chosen (randomly?). I had flown numerous airlines in my life   but such thing was never happened  but only with Emirates! Even though with my insistence  the issue was solved and I got a seat at Stansted  this incident already left me a bad impression about this airline. If there is an option  IÃ¢ÂÂd doubt if I will ever fly with Emirates ever again as this experience was no fun at all.', 'Colombo to Dubai. The service was excellent at the Check in counter and also with the Cabin Crew. The cabin crew was concerned about the passenger comfort.', ""Johannesburg to Rome via Dubai. I have been waiting for longer than months since my flight last July with no response from Emirates all.  First I had no idea why Emirates is delayed for 6 hours out of JNB was because of technical issues which caused me to missed my connecting flight to Europe. The IFE on my seat does not work since this is an old plane that I've take and this is unacceptable for me to go without IFE on such a long flight. Upon arrival into Dubai  I was rescheduled to another day with Emirates as the result of the delay flight. I have nowhere to sleep by then. This is unacceptable and a total nightmare for the whole journey. After longer time since I sent a report to Emirates without any answer at all. This is the last time I fly Emirates."", 'Birmingham to Kathmandu via Dubai. Emirates used to be best airline for me   but this time really unhappy with the services at the check-in area. I booked the wheelchair for my grandparent  i didnÃ¢ÂÂt get any help or information from her when we check so my grandparents had to walk way to plane. There were so many peoples who were carrying too many bags but didÃ¢ÂÂt weigh their luggage and bags - but why only us.  I donÃ¢ÂÂt mind for paying but it should be fair to everyone. So unhappy with the emirates flight never going use this airline again. Paid ÃÂ£88 for nothing', 'Barcelona to Dubai. A cabin crew damaged my belongings.  Just before the captain commenced descent  against my advice  staff shoved and crushed several of my airport purchases into a almost full overhead compartment above me  in my full view. Prior to this  I'd request twice for assistance to find a suitable space  not the one above me  but my request was totally ignored. Upon landing for disembarkment  I approached the cabin crew supervisor and showed him the damages done on my purchases by one of his crew. He expressed his apologies and advised I write in to Emirates as there nothing other than apologies he can offer. He was also shown the almost-full state of the compartment directly above us where the packagings were crushed and damaged. I wrote to Emirates and below is their ""not my problem"" template reply from Customer Service Thank you for your correspondence of 03 October 2018 regarding Emirates flight EK 186 from Barcelona to Dubai on 29 September. I regret to learn that you found your biscuit box dented on the above flight. However  I am required to highlight that personal belongings brought onboard are the responsibility of each individual passenger  and the airline cannot accept responsibility for loss of  or damage to  personal items. According to our records  as you were sitting in the bulkhead row  you were advised that all bags and loose items have to be stowed for landing in the overhead lockers. It is my understanding that you did not inform the cabin crew that your bags contained fragile items. Notwithstanding the above  we certainly appreciate you bringing your experience to our attention  and I wish to assure you that your comments  along with the Cabin Supervisor's report  have been shared with the departments concerned. This enables them to take appropriate internal action to improve the standard of service offered to our customers. I can also advise that the cabin crew operating in Economy class on this flight have received guidance in this regard. Please accept my apologies for not having met your expectations on this occasion. I hope that we can leave you with a more positive impression on your future flights with us. Emirates services from both cabin and ground (customer service) had changed over the years and this has been the worst I'd ever encountered.', ""Dubai to Sao Paulo. Flying experience nothing out of ordinary  but this company doesn't respect customer. They damage my luggage did an agreement in the airport  sent the e-mail with the case. Didn't pay and said case closed. Never replied any e-mail or answer phone call."", 'The flight from London to Dubai is good but not from Dubai to Colombo which is operated by flydubai. Customer service from cabin crew is very poor and is one of ignorance.  Also the transport between terminals are too slow that I managed to get to the next flight last minute.', ""Orlando to Hargeisa via Dubai. I was traveling for business purposes  so I needed to take 6 bags and was willing to pay the extra fees for the many overweight pieces of baggage. I agreed to pay $950 for the baggage to be accepted and taken to my destination  which was Hargeisa. When I got to Dubai  they canceled my connection flight to Hargeisa  so they rescheduled me onto an Ethiopian Airline flight to Hargeisa  which I was fine with  but later I wanted a refund because  in order for my bags to reach the destination  I had to pay $1600 to Ethiopian Airlines  and the agreement with Emirates was to take my baggage to my destination for the $950. I asked Emirates for a refund because they canceled the flight and rescheduled me   but they refused and said it's not their fault and since I paid the $950 and used Emirates airlines until Dubai  they cannot accept my refund."", ""Sydney to Paris via Dubai. I have been travelling with Emirates with the past 10 years. I flew for the second time in business class and the service has been the worst I have ever had. A had a stop over in Dubai  and I had a confirmation email from Emirates and a print out from the Emirates counter in Sydney while I did my check-in. A chauffeur was booked to pick me and my daughter up and we had a hotel room booked complimentary from Emirates. When we arrived in Dubai  no one from Emirates helped me to find my chauffeur. I went to the Emirates counter and the person who was really unhelpful  cancelled my booking without asking me anything and was very rude! I had to wait for hours at the airport with my 17 months daughter. I was expecting much more from the business class from Emirates. The cabin crew during the flights was average. While my daughter was sleeping I asked one one of the crew to look after her while I was in the bathroom. She showed me that she was really annoyed to help me  she finally decided to stay as I asked her if I could get someone else to help me if she didn't want to do it. The cabin crew was eating food in front of clients and was not in a hurry to help clients. I sent a complain on the Emirates website and they answered that it will take up to 30 days before I hear from them - this unacceptable. The business class is expensive enough to deserve the treatment that goes with it. I will never book another business flight ticket with Emirates anymore."", 'I had a flight from Bangkok to Lisbon via Dubai in August 2018  and the flight was amazing! the food was good  the entertainment system was a little old but was great  and the flight crew nice!', 'Jakarta to London via Dubai. IÃ¢ÂÂm shocked by how terrible the service was. The in flight entertainment is arguably one of the best  the food is okay (nothing special but good enough)  but the service provided by the flight attendants was absolutely appalling. I received no help whatsoever from the stewardess nearby in loading/unloading my baggage  even though I was clearly seen struggling. I was very thirsty mid-flight and requested for the flight attendant to ask for water  but unfortunately no one showed up. The general attitude was unfriendly and unenthusiastic. I would absolutely opt for alternative airlines (and there are plenty) when making this trip in the future.', 'Hong Kong to Dubai via Heathrow. I found the staff bossy  patronizing and unhelpful. They were either too busy to answer questions or simply not there. Wifi supposedly available but never worked  remote control jammed in latched position  no printed wine list available. I am surprised at how poor I found the service. Qantas was far superior.', ""Manchester to Mauritius via Dubai. First flight with Emirates. Not impressed. On outward and inward flights our choice of meals were not available. On return flight sea food only available. I'm allergic to this so did not have a meal. No amenity kits were available despite all flights being long haul. I enquired via live chat if I could take a hand bag and a small piece of cabin luggage before I flew. I was told strictly one piece only per person. Most ladies had a hand baggage and a travel bag with them. Travelled with golf bags and only were allowed 30kg including suitcases. Most other airlines allow much more than this. Not impressed at all."", 'Dubai to Johannesburg. Emirates is a joke. We were given a ""E"" and ""F"" seats at check in  on a horribly tight 3-4-3 configuration. We asked if we could be given a window or aisle seat but was refused. The check in staff then called her supervisor and said ""Hi  I am calling as two passengers would like to change their seats. I want to call because I want to let them know I have put in my effort and you can just say a no so I can please them"". This is humiliating. On the flight  the seats were the tightest I have met in economy class. The highly rated ICE system was a joke - they claimed to have over 3000 hours of inflight entertainment but in fact  most movies were the unpopular or old ones. The so called free wifi allowed you for 10 minutes of messaging only.  The food is ok  but nothing to cry for. The crews were mostly impolite  and even for the polite ones  not proactive to help on anything. We had a tight connection (1 hour which we need to collect our bags and recheck again) and asked if we could be seated to the front of the aircraft for quick disembarkation. One of the crews ignored our requests and the one other one just said  ""oh  do it on your own"". This is the most horrible flight I have had with international flights!']","[(0, '0.028*""flight"" + 0.016*""dubai"" + 0.016*""emirate"" + 0.009*""crew"" + 0.007*""seat"" + 0.007*""via"" + 0.007*""airline"" + 0.007*""return"" + 0.007*""one"" + 0.007*""could"" + 0.006*""meal"" + 0.006*""time"" + 0.005*""passenger"" + 0.005*""back"" + 0.005*""said""')]"
