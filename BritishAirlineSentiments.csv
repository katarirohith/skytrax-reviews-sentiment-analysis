Phoenix to Accra via London. I had a great Customer service treatment at the check in at Phoenix by the young lady who checked me in. She was very professional and handled my check in process excellently. My entire trip was great and I really was treated very well also on my final leg to Accra by the BA staff in London as well. Just want to appreciate this gesture of professionalism by the staff.,Positive
 Manchester to London. The bag drop process took an hour even though I had checked in already. The staff offered little apology  explaining that there was a big group ahead and they could do nothing about this. Staff on the flight were clumsy and rude  one attendant dropped a water bottle on my shoulder and offered the merest apology. Another flight attendant didnt bother to ask customers in the last rows if they wanted refreshments. Not exactly best of British  and Ill certainly not be recommending,Negative
 San Diego to Hannover via London. I booked on ba.com  the longer flights both ways in premium economy.  On the return I was informed at San Diego that the American Airlines flight into DFW was severely delayed and I would miss my flight into London. American Airlines could book me on a later flight the same day  but had only  coach available. If I insisted on premier economy I could fly in 3 days. I took the coach and American assured my that BA would refund the fare difference for this downgrade. After arrival at home I contacted BA on their website to refund the fare difference. A bizarre exchange followed. First they said you did not buy any upgraded seat. I told them to look at the ticket. You cant get a refund because the economy class seat was much more expensive that the booked premium economy seat. I contacted BA Germany who said you get a refund  but you booked this with a travel agent  so we are not in charge.  I booked with BA on their website. They saidthey would send this to London so they can compute the refund  but then you cant get a refund because your seat was much more expensive than the premium seat you booked months in advance. The change in booking was the sole fault of the delayed American Airlines flight. This is miserable customer service.,Positive
 London Heathrow to Stuttgart. Absolutely disgusted with BA. my husband was asked to put his one piece of hand luggage in the hold due to the flight being busy and he agreed. BA had one job to do  put it in the hold and make sure it arrives in Stuttgart. This has proven too difficult. The bag is lost and they have not offered any assistance or support.,Negative
 London to Johannesburg. Turning right to the first wing at T5 was a new experience for us. It was all pretty slick  although the guy at checkin wasnt exactly Mr Convivial. The Concorde Room was impressive  too  particularly the terrace with its quirky interior design  overlooking the main concourse. Boarding involved lining up according to group. This smacked a bit of lowcost airlines  but I guess thats necessary with all the passengers on a doubledecker plane. The first cabin on the A380 is definitely more spacious than on a 747 and the suites also had more room and extra storage space. The dividers seemed higher  too  giving better privacy. The fact that the cabin was only half full was another bonus. Cabin crew were friendly  attentive and thoroughly professional. Food was good  too  and demonstrated that airline food can be of restaurant quality if the cabin crew use reheating facilities properly. The wines on offer were a good selection  including the fabulous LPGS  and we enjoyed some wine tasting. Sleep quality was considerably better than Club World  although the cabin temperature was a little high. Overall  an excellent flight that fully met the brief of first class travel.,Positive
 Having booked BA Business Class and paid extra for the seat selection on the Boeing 787  I was disappointed to have the flight rescheduled. I rejected BAs offer of flying on Belgian Air and had to change my flight to get a different BA aircraft. When I booked in the window seat selections had been lost. My husband and I were forced to sit separately. At the booking in I was told that they could not find proof that I had paid for selected seats. I could not prove the payment because the booking number had changed with the new flights. Spooning with a stranger in the centre isle was not the trip I planned. On the return flight again  sitting apart from my husband my TV did not work. The staff could not have been nicer  but could not find an alternative seat. On return  BA customer complaints offered a 400 voucher on my next flight. Despite sending two detailed messages  I received the same response. Completely inadequate service by BA not the flight attendants in delivering the flights I paid for and dealing with the complaints.,Negative
 Vancouver to London Heathrow. I chose to fly with them because I had been told they were good for families and as I was traveling with my 8 month old alone this was what I needed. The booking process was not smooth and very stressful  I have to call customer service multiple times and they need to improve their customer service call center. The 2 flights were great though  the staff both on the ground and in the air were very helpful and did everything they could to ensure I was doing ok. The crew came around often with drinks and the food was ok I was first given a cot for my baby. I originally wanted a one of the Britax seats they have but was talked out it saying my baby would be more comfortable in the cot  nope He was too big and could not lie straight so I asked for it to be switched out and he was asleep with 15 minutes. All the toilets in economy were out of order at least 3 hours before we reached our destination so everyone had to used the business class toilets  Im sure that was annoying for the people seated there and lines were constant.,Positive
 Boston to Nairobi via London. The only good thing was the new and clean looking plane for the first leg of the trip from Boston to Heathrow. The cabin crew service was below standard. I had a window seat and twice I was passed up and not offered anything to eatdrink while everyone around me was  simply because I was watching a movie. I  noticed that if you didnt have eye contact with the attendant you were not offered anything. Airplane food is not exactly gourmet but BA food was so bland even the little I ate was only because I was hungry. The connecting flight from Heathrow to Nairobi was  worse because the plane was the  opposite of the one from Boston to Heathrow. It looked beat up and lacked even the basics like a USB port. Cabin crew service on this leg was  below standard. Im probably to blame because I overrated BA before flying with them but now I know better.,Positive
 Basel to San Fransisco via Heathrow. Im convinced the quality has dropped considerably in the past several years. I booked World Traveller Plus or Premium Economy which costs appr. twice as much as economy. The flight to SFO was ok seat wise as the plane was an A380 and I has reserved an aisle seat. The food was disgusting for me  during the flight we were given a box with several pieces of junk food and shortly before landing given a piece of pizza. The choice of food leaves a lot to be desired. There were cold drinks offered regularly and you can go to the bulkhead to get extra if needed. We were offered maybe two hot drinks during the 12 hours on the plane longer due to a delay leaving the UK. The flight back to the UK was worse since it was a Boeing 747 with the older bulkier seats. You couldnt even get to the remote control hidden in the inside of the seat and Im not big. The recliner didnt work properly and the general space around the seat is cramped as the person next to me spilled over to my seat. I feel sorry for larger people. The food was just as bland and poor and barely any warm drinks. The staff seem challenged with certain situations. Next time Im off to the US I will look for an alternative airline.,Negative
 London to Lyon. The flight has 1h 30 delay for a flight duration of 130. Ground staff forced me to checkin my suitcase during boarding process due to lack of space in the plane and I got my suitcase damaged with 2 big cuts on the back. Then the customer service has been very useless. Such a very bad experience. I do not recommend flying with them.,Negative
 London to Boston. I was seated next to a customer who was needed an extra seat. The flight attendant was extremely nice and helpful and ensured I was comfortable throughout the flight. Superb Customer Service.,Positive
 Stockholm to London. Standard configuration on short haul European flights. Business class still 3 seats each side of the isle. Middle seat fitted with a tray. Had a wonderful crew with 2 super professional stewards in business. Drinks served with a smile and the food also. Food reminding of what was served in economy 10 years ago when there still was free there. The best part of the meal was the cheese and pudding.,Positive
 Amsterdam to London arrived 33 minutes late  three delays  taking off  landing  and getting the walkway to the airplane. This has happened twice this year. I fly KLM 90 of the time on this route and am delayed very rarely. I fly British on this route  when it is significantly cheaper but am delayed. Im sure its bad luck but if you do better than double the flight time you are having a good day.,Positive
 Buenos Aires to London. We flew overnight Friday 9th November. The plane seating is worn out and uncomfortable  there were large numbers or Argentinian passengers on the plane yet I saw no staff that spoke Spanish. The chicken dinner was described as Curry but there was no sauce on it. The bread roll was stale and dessert stodgy  During the night no water was offered to me. It was not possible to charge electronic equipment  the seatback screens were small with a limited choice of entertainment.,Negative
 Business Class space is ridiculously narrow. Service is very careless. You are not allowed laptops on the flight from Riyadh  so you cannot work if you want to. You cannot choose when to eat.,Negative
 Aberdeen to Heathrow to connect to a flight in Gatwick the day after. During checkin using the BA app  there was a problem that I had to restart  after that when I opened noted that the boarding pass was issued not allowing me to add a bag in the hold. After calling BA and explaining the situation was told that the option was to pay 65 at the airport desk. What a rip off for a short flight. By curiosity I checked with Easyjet and if I had booked with them for the same day would had cost me the same to fly as the money BA asked for the bag.,Positive
 I would not recommend this airline. I travel a lot for work and get to fly different airlines so have a good base to compare it to. Baggage Allowance Only give you 23kgs of checked baggage and if you are 1 kg over regardless if your other bags with your other travel companions are under you have to pay 170AUD extra. This is the strictest airline I have ever used. All other airlines have allowed up to 5kgs over at no charge. Ensure you have preweighed all bags. Inflight meal On the way to Sydney  they served soggy squashed sandwiches as a meal. It is an 8 hour flight Make sure you pack your own snacksmeal. You dont get a bottle of water and they rarely serve drinks. Make sure you prepack a bottle or two once you are through customs. Customer service From the get go the customer service was appalling. It is hard enough traveling with kids  but having to deal with BA was stressful. They wouldnt allow me to swap my ticket with my husband as we were traveling with my kids and I had a slight delay which meant I couldnt go on the same flight. At the airport  they couldnt find my childrens booking which caused further delay and stress. How do you misplace 4 kids on the same booking They then put my husband in a seat not with all of us and wouldnt do anything to help change this. We had to ask the person next to my kids once on the plane on our own. Dont bother flying BA.,Positive
 New York to Budapest via London. The second flight was a bit different. The plane was clean  but cold. I wanted to drink water  but the cabin crew does not accepted my request. By mistake the captain welcomed the passengers to Bucharest and not Budapest.,Negative
 Heathrow to Athens on A321. Arrived at the airport in time and bag drop was an ease. Got to the gate within 30mins of bag drop with light security queues. On the aircraft  there was sufficient seat legroom for my seat 7F.  A funny safety video played and the flight was smooth. No food was served  except some MS  BBC news was playing on the screens  with no sound and Russian captions  quite confusing. The plane landed half an hour late  but it was the best landing I have ever experienced.,Positive
 London to Bangkok. I am not a fan if the BA configuration in Business. However I did have seat 2J so it was right up front. I am not sure where to begin. Food awful  I ordered beef a showcase of British beef the notes said that was inedible I left most of it. Instead of asking was something wrong or would I like another meal option  the FA took the tray away and asked if I wanted dessert. Wine 2 reds 2 whites and 2 champagnes  hardly a stellar wine list. Entertainment small screen with dreadful resolution and a very limited ordinary range of options. Staff challenged at best  clearly some had not been in business before. Disengaged and disinterested. The cabin was over hill for me. The toilet was not checked very often  a sweet wrapper remained on the toilet floor the entire trip as did an overflowing rubbish bin. I would expect much better up the front of the plane we pay a premium to be there and the service and overall product do not match expectations.,Negative
 Abu Dhabi to London. Although a BA flight  this sector was operated by Air Belgium and offered a really poor experience. Aircraft felt old and tired  cabin crew were totally indifferent  cabin temperature was too hot and stuffy and food totally inedible. A really awful flight and worth looking at alternatives if you need to fly this route in the near future.,Negative
 Gatwick to Orlando. Stains on the seat  cotton buds in the seat well. Disgusting and had to force them to clean. No entertainment on board  it was not functional. Internet available at three times Emirates price and twice AA flight and speed that wont achieve streaming. When I complained to BA they told me I couldnt communicate with the CEO but I could connect with their customer relations. I have been Gold on BA for thirty years and its time to ditch this non responsive airline.,Negative
 Newcastle to Las Vegas via London. Both my flights were great  on time and the food was good on the flight to London  and a nice bottle of champagne as well. My long haul flight was also good  aircraft was 20yrs old but clean  cabin crew were very nice  friendly and efficient  my pre ordered meal was absolutely fantastic  the only complaint I can have is the in flight entertainment needs to be improved  ie  try showing some classic British comedy programmes instead of the unfunny modern stuff  and also include some good classic rock music that people have actually heard of  apart from that  absolutely great  well recommended.,Positive
 While it is still fresh in my mind  Id like to commend the hard working crew of my BA flight from St.Petersburg to London Heathrow on 23rd October 2018. The checkin staff were very professional and helpful and assisted me with a query. Boarding was operated remarkably efficiently and in a precise and orderly manner. The cabin crew were welcoming and very professional in their appearance and demeanor too. The cabin was spotlessly clean and the flight departed on time and arrived slightly early. The captain was informative. My only gripe was the lack of a route map on this flight and the MS buy on board option was a bit tedious. Disembarkation was equally well managed and passengers were fare welled in a courteous and sincere way. This flight has restored my faith in BA. Well done to the superb crew,Positive
 London to Philadelphia. I upgraded from coach to business for almost 900 because I  wanted to experience BAs business class in the Boeing 787  but I was disappointed. While the aircraft was new  the staff really could have cared less about the business guests. 232 in business with some seats facing the cockpit and others the tail. BA lost me as a traveler because the crew although polite  service wise was lacking. Preflight they offer you a beverage  I asked for rose champagne and I was told I guess I have to go find a bottle and open one. In my previous business class experiences there are beverages served every 2 hours  not on this almost 8 hour flight. I was served my main meal almost 2.5 hours after takeoff. You get one full hot meal and a snack one hour and a half before landing. You also get an initial beverage and then the next time a beverage is offered is 1.5 hours before landing. If you ask for anything else to drink in between you have to go into the galley. Yes they have the menu  linen  silverware and glass but you feel like they just have to do this for you and not like they want to do this for you. Because of the extra seat they cram into business now they are all very narrow and really uncomfortable. There was virtually no storage other than a small laptop droor and thats it. I have to say the entertainment options were very good and there was no WiFi on this flight. You get a pillow  duvet and blanket and a decent amenity kit. BA has the new planes  and decent business amenities however they lost me in the service. I will not pay to upgrade to business on BA and will avoid flying with them if I have another option. They need to improve when it comes to inflight experiences and treatment specially for their business class travelers.,Positive
 Madrid to London. Good improvement. This BA club Europe flight was on a B777 so seats were flat beds. BA have updated their menus so instead of serving a sandwich they offered a full meal service. Three choices of main and food was good quality. Good BA listened to feedback. They were as always let down by their Iberia partners in that their Madrid business lounge was abysmal as usual. With no toilets available and the lone tortilla as the unique culinary offering along with dirty tables,Positive
 London to Munich. The ground staff were very friendly and the plane was clean. Once boarding was completed we were informed that due to issues with the tower the flight would be delayed by 40 minutes. They hadnt finished loading the baggage and this was clear from the view out of the window  where you could see bags still arriving and being loaded after our scheduled departure. Aircrew were functional but this must have been the last flight of the day and you noticed it. Flight was uneventful they had the flight tracking screen down for 30 minutes before they retracted. Other than being lied to as to the reason for the delay the flight offered the minimum required.,Positive
 London to Cape Town.  Waiting at gate  the staff announced flight will be delayed because cabin temperature is too high. Air conditioning problem on board. She said all doors of aircraft have been opened  lights dimmed or switched off to decrease temperature  boarding will start as soon as possible. Finally one hour after take off temperature became acceptable.,Positive
 Full flight from MUC to LHR with British Airways. On the plus side the ground and cabin crew are very friendly  so is the baggage allowance  plane although not new was clean. You have to pay for your food and beverages on board short haul flights. The departure was delayed by 45 minutes and a further delay on arrival for a total of 55 minutes later than expected. We also parked at a gate at the very far end of T5. The plus side of all the walking was that the luggage was there waiting for us. Service as expected for the price and that would be the reason for choosing them again. When traveling with an infant the delays tend to compound matters.,Positive
 Manchester to Philadelphia via London. MANLHR I am not tall so the Club Europe seating is fine for me on a short flight. Addressed by name  adequate breakfast of bacon roll  fruit and yoghurt. Concorde Room not crowded and no wait for showers. LHRPHL on aged 747 but still my favorite  cabinwashrooms in very good shape though. I have no problem with the BA F layout unlike so many posters here. Excellent flight  experienced crew and though full cabin  all very smooth and professional. Beautifully prepared and presented lamb shank  good wines as always  nice to see a good British bubbly included. Only downside was deplaning in PHL where F passengers had to fight their way off through the J scrum  could have been controlled by crew  but was not.,Positive
 Bangkok to London. Seating and interior old with a very small IFE screen. I did not like the meals. Had a short connection and i was rebooked from another partner. Upon arrival in LHR others for the same connecting flight were awaited but not me. I was told there would be service agents in purple everywhere but I found none. The fast track security was non existant. Total experience was bad.,Negative
